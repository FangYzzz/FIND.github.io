# UniIntervene — Project Page

Static project / paper page for **UniIntervene: Agentic Intervention for Efficient
Real-World Reinforcement Learning**, accepted to **CoRL 2026**. Pure HTML/CSS/JS,
no build step.

```

## Preview locally

```bash
cd website
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a repo and push the **contents of this `website/` folder** to the repo root
   (so `index.html` sits at the top level).
2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from a branch**,
   pick `main` and `/ (root)`.
3. The page goes live at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

> Keeping the page in a subfolder instead? Push the whole repo and set Pages to the
> `/docs` folder (rename `website` → `docs`), or use a GitHub Action that publishes
> `website/` as the Pages artifact.

## Before going public — fill in the placeholders

The code link is still stubbed with `href="#"`. Search `index.html` and replace it
once the repository is public:

- **Code** button in the hero (`<a class="btn ...">`).

The YouTube overview video and all figures/clips are already wired up.

## Regenerating the figures

The images were rasterized from the paper's PDF figures with PyMuPDF + Pillow
(`Fig/Teaser0529.pdf`, `Pipeline0529.pdf`, `Tasks.pdf`, `Case_study.pdf`,
`real_world.pdf`). Re-run that conversion if the source figures change.
